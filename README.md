# SeedBot Modules

To get started with the new SeedBot you can download the latest version of all the official modules by cloning the repository into your SeedBot base location.

If you want to install individual modules just copy the folder of the module you want (e.g basic/) to your modules folder inside of your SeedBot installation, restart your instance and then the module will be automatically detected. For some modules more than this is required, if so the module will alert you in the console.
