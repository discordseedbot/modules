	"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase ''Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,'' which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ",

Say Shrek, Shrek oh how'd you get so green. Shrek, Shrek yo what's your favorite cuisine. I eat frogs, and dogs, and dung beetle pie. Sometimes I eat my son and I don't know why.

	"I was only nine years old. I loved Shrek so much, I had all the merchandise and movies. I'd pray to Shrek every night before I go to bed, thanking for the life I've been given. ''Shrek is love'', I would say, ''Shrek is life''. My dad hears me and calls me a faggot. I knew he was just jealous for my devotion of Shrek. I called him a cunt. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it's really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. It's Shrek. I'm so happy. He whispers in my ear, ''This is my swamp''. He grabs me with his powerful ogre hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I spread my ass-cheeks for Shrek. He penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for Shrek. I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force. I want to please Shrek. He roars a mighty roar, as he fills my butt with his love. My dad walks in. Shrek looks him straight in the eye, and says, ''It's all ogre now''. Shrek leaves through my window. Shrek is love. Shrek is life.Ôªø",

They're fucking... big can't find shit. There's shit everywhere, there's shit nowhere. Number 8, why is everything so fucking big. I just want a god damn small box of cereal and all they're giving me is family packs. I don't want family packs! And if I do find a small pack of cereal, all it's in is a fucking bundle! So you have to buy 20 of them, in one go! It's like what the FUCK! It's huge. Oh uh number 7, why is it so expensive? I only have like, 3 bucks in my account. I want cereal! Why do I have to spend like 200 bucks on 20 packs of cereal like... c'mon! Then we go to number 6 and then we got fucking... food court! Like, the lines are too long. What the fuck? I'm trying to get food and the food court lines are just too fucking long! Number 5 is white people. Fucking they're a sin! Like walk in there, and fucking Karen's like, ''Oh little Timmy! Let's go to the cereal section and find you some Wheat Thins.''. Bitch I don't want some fucking Wheat Thins! I want my Mini Wheat! Regular size. I only have 2 bucks! C'mon bitch. Why don't you take me to a better store! Number 4, people in the food court lines fucking decide what you want! There's pizza, there's salad, there's fries, there's ice cream. That's it. I think there's a sandwich too but who the fuck gets a sandwich at a food court line at Costco. God damnit! Get some better fucking food choices! Number 3, the food court options are shit! Every time I eat food court food I almost shit my pants with how bad it tastes. My rectum has never been the same ever since I ate a pizza. Fucking shit slid out! What the fuck, shits not supposed to do that! Now onto number 2, they're so fucking big! They don't have my brand! I want my cereal brand but they don't have it. AHHHHH! I just want my food, please!

That I needed to stop lifting weights in my room, stop watching tv in the basement, stop playing video games on my Intellivision.'' I have always had that voice in the back of my head. I have moved out on my own and started a family, but I for the past 22 years I just keep coming back to what my momma said.\n\n Well I finally did something about it and used the interwebs at my local buffet style family dining establishment (borrowing my momma's smartphone) and ordered the TP-Link AC1750 Smart WiFi Router, as a companion piece to a modem surfboard. I am not what you would call well with the electronics, but this piece of manufacturing was easy for me to set up and even brought my son and I closer together as we worked on it as a daddy/son project.\n\n Once this was set up the whole family dynamic changed, the kids no longer fight with each other, my wife no longer hollers stuff to me at my face, we watch the entertainment on the tv with the airdropping of shows and movies.\n\n My momma was right... there is a whole great big world out there, and now my family and I can see it wireless from our phones and tablets!",
	"> ***The Phantom Shitter***\n\n I used to roll half a bottle of laxative pills into a Crunch wrap supreme and then leave cow pies on peoples door mats. People in my town installed porch cameras to catch the ''Phantom Shitter'' they said it couldn't possibly be one man, the hits were too frequent and too large. It had to be a whole gang of city punks coordinating and making planned precision strikes. I felt like a god among lesser beings in my town. Every time i was at the local diner and i overheard someone screaming about the black slop they found on their porch i felt powerful and unstoppable. I became too arrogant, started striking during the day. That's when they caught me and strung me up in the streets and hit me with rocks. I barely escaped with my life and i had to leave town. Now after all these years, I'm in a new town and I behave well enough. But I've got this nagging feeling, the urge is back, and I'm starting to think that my new town is about to experience a storm."
